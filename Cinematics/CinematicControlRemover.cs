        Why Needed?

        A bug exists where the player still has the control
        of the playable character when the cutscene is playing.

        How to solve?

        Add observers, these will watch over the completion, pause, or start
        of an action and let you take control of them.

        Observers are similar to interfaces, as they transfer the dependencies.
